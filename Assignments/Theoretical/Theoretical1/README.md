# Instructions for Theoretical 1
The assignment is contained in the notebook
`theoretical1_sentiment_analysis_version`. The notebook uses the data
file `data_for_theoretical_notebook_1.csv`. The notebook
`data_pre_process.ipynb` is only for instructional purposes. It is an
example of how to do natural language preprocessing.

If you want to do the pre-processing yourself, then you will need to
uncompress `twitter_sentiment_analysis.csv.gz` using `gzip` or
something similar.
